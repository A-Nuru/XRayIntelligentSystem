# XRayIntelligentSystem
AN EFFICIENT INTELLIGENT ANALYSIS SYSTEM FOR CLASSIFYING X-RAY IMAGES OF BODY PARTS
- An X-ray classification algorithm aids clinical care and treatment by enhancing faster classification and error free interpretation of X-ray images, thereby conserves time for other important tasks. 
- The challenge is to build a classifier that can classify any given X-ray image. 
- The provided dataset consists of 6 categories of X-ray images namely: AbdomenCT, BreastMRI, CXR, ChestCT, Hand and HeadCT. 
- Since the dataset is large enough and sufficient for training a Deep Learning model, a Deep Convolutional Neural Network that automatically extracts image features (with optimal representation) is used to reduce the model computational time, thus increasing efficiency. 
- The built model classifies a given X-ray image of body parts into one of the 6 classes with up to 99.95 % accuracy on test set.
